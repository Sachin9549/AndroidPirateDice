# Introduction
In my childhood I very liked to play in the Pirates board game ([published in the Pioner magazine #6 1989](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxHnNp97IgMRem0yUWNwTzEyVVk&authuser=0)), it is great game developed by Vasily Golytsyn in 1934.

The Main problem for the game is that the game needs special dice to play

My friend made such device for our games but at present we have nice smartphones and I decided to make Android version of such dice.
