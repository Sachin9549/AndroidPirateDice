# Introduction
In my childhood I very liked to play in the Pirates board game ([published in the Pioner magazine #6 1989](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxHnNp97IgMRem0yUWNwTzEyVVk&authuser=0)), it is great game developed by Vasily Golytsyn in 1934.

The Main problem for the game is that the game needs special dice to play

My friend made such device for our games but at present we have nice smartphones and I decided to make Android version of such dice.
# How to install?
The Android application is compatible with Android 2.1+. Either build it self or [download my prebuilt APK file](https://github.com/raydac/AndroidPirateDice/releases/download/1.0.2/PirateDice.apk) and install to your device. 
# How to use?
After start you will see the dice indicator. Just touch the screen to start turn.

Also the applications can work wit non-touch screens so that it can be started even on Android based TV devices like IconBit Toucan 3D

# How to change the dice layout?
To change the dice layout to PRO or REDESIGNED versions is very easy, just open the menu of the application and select 'Pro' item. Every layout change, the menu item will be changing its name to the next layout identifier.
